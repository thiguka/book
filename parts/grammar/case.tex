\subsection{Case}
Thiguka features six cases, with their own specific uses.

    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Nominative}
Nominative case is used in Thiguka to mark subjects.

\subsubsection{Accusative}
Nominative case is used in Thiguka to mark objects.

\subsubsection{Dative}
Dative case is used in Thiguka, in the below examples.

\subsubsection{Genitive}
Genitive case has only been used by Lemuria in his Thiguka writings, to indicate posession.

\begin{exe}
\ex{} \gll{}Kasa-pah     gulaya     Gahlija-pafay gahlirithi.\\
            PROX.DET-NOM COP.3SG.PRS Gallia-GEN   violin\\
    \glt{}``This is Gallia's violin.''
\end{exe}

\subsubsection{Locative}
Locative case is used for a location or a time something happened.
It can be combined with the preposition \textit{ifil}.

\begin{exe}
\ex{} \gll{}Pothu-pah pa-teligara-ta        ifil Los Algeles-kala ifil literidilay-kala\\
            3SG-NOM   PFV-twitch.stream-PST in   Los Angeles-LOC  in   yesterday-LOC\\
    \glt{}``She streamed on Twitch in Los Angeles yesterday.'' (lit. ``She streamed on Twitch in Los Angeles, in yesterday'')
\end{exe}

\subsubsection{Instrumental}
Instrumental case is used to denote, in general, the methods through which the subject did something.

\begin{exe}
\ex{} \gll{}Pothu-pah pa-sapakalakesi-ta ka\~{}gu-rifari  kalakesi Lipset-kithi ifil Los Algeles-kala, Kaliforlija-kala.\\
            3SG-NOM   PFV-graduate-PST   \agradj{}-music  school   Lipsett-INS  in   Los Angeles-LOC   California-LOC.\\
    \glt{}``She graduated from the music school under Lipsett in Los Angeles, California.''
\end{exe}
In this example, perhaps Lipsett had been ``her'' primary music teacher the whole time she was at the school.
