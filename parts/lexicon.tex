\chapter{Lexicon}
Thiguka, as of May 2024, has about 350 defined words, with slight bias towards Internet and music-related terminology.

Thiguka's full lexicon is available at \url{https://github.com/thiguka/lexicon} in both tab-separated values format and an Anki deck.

\section{Word lists}
While not a full dictionary, these are some interesting words that Lemuria has found particularly important.
