\subsection{Unusual roots}
Thiguka has some specific roots that many natlangs would need an entire sentence or even paragraph to describe.
These roots are an extension of Lemuria's personality, condensing the things and concepts of significance to his life into one word.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item ketala --- fear of being banned by a moderator on the Internet while asleep
    \item filay- --- from English feline; prefix to indicate ``with cat present''
    \item katarila --- space travel; because Lemuria asked someone (Catarina) in the Conlangs Discord Network too many questions about 3SG.GEN far-future world.
    \item orielija --- to sail away. Combination of Orinoco + Enya (whose name gets loaned as Elija due to Thiguka being a Lo Lasals Lalguage.)
\end{enumerate}
