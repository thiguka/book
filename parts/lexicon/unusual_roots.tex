\subsection{Unusual roots}
Thiguka has some specific roots that many natlangs would need an entire sentence or even paragraph to describe.
These roots are an extension of Lemuria's personality, condensing the things and concepts of significance to his life into one word.



\textbf{ketala} --- v. fear of being banned by a moderator on the Internet while asleep

\textbf{filay-} --- prefix to indicate ``with cat present''; from English \textit{feline}

\textbf{katarila} --- v. space travel; Because Lemuria asked someone (Catarina) in the Conlangs Discord Network too many questions about 3SG.GEN far-future world.

\textbf{orielija} --- v. to sail away; Combination of Orinoco + Enya (whose name gets loaned as Elija due to Thiguka being a Lo Lasals Lalguage.)
