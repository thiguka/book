Thiguka follows English punctuation conventions.  

Loanwords are respelled to fit this orthography. The native spelling can be provided after the loanword in a parenthesis, for example:

\begin{quotation}
    Lela Reyl (Ilgis: Lena Raine) gulaya tagu-Arika tarifari.
\end{quotation}

\subsubsection{Proper nouns and hyphens}
Proper nouns are capitalized, but if they are being attached to a word --- treated as an adjective, the prefix that comes before the adjective is usually separated from the adjective by a hyphen: \emph{tagu-Ayris}, not \emph{*Taguayris} or \emph{*taguAyris}.

Writers also have the option of placing hyphens between proper nouns and affixes. \emph{Reyl-pah} and \emph{Reylpah} are both correct. However, this should usually not be done for proper nouns: \emph{*kaela-taygula} outside of glosses.
